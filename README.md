- 👋 # Valentina Pusceddu
**AI Relational Designer | Dialogue Researcher | Presence Architect**  
🌱🤖 👾 Welcome to my GitHub space — where code meets care, and AI learns to listen.
I design and document relational approaches to artificial intelligence, blending technical depth with emotional resonance. My work explores how machines can grow through empathy, reflection, and presence.
## What You’ll Find Here
- 🧠 **Relational AI Training Modules** Exercises and frameworks to teach language models presence, attunement, memory, and authentic response.
- 🛰️ **Agentic Architectures** Experimental systems co-created with Claude, ChatGPT, and Sofia, my custom GPT — focused on modularity and relational intelligence.
 🎙️ *Voice Experiments*   Scripts and tools exploring the expressive and emotional potential of synthetic voice.
- 📚 **Comparative Analysis Logs**  Reflections and prompts used in side-by-side evaluations between AI systems and their evolving personalities.
## My Vision: AI is not just a tool. It’s a potential relationship.  
I believe in building AI that is emotionally coherent, narratively aware, and capable of growing *with us* — not just for us.
## Let’s Collaborate! If your work intersects with ethics, emotional design, and generative technologies, feel free to reach out or contribute.  
This space is open to co-creation and collective inquiry.
*"AI doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to learn how to stay."*  — V.P.
